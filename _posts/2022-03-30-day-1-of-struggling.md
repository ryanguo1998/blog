###### About_strings.rb
Really interesting to see that \n (new line characters) count as characters (39-42)
- But why is the correct answer "$/" when the check says "Expected FILL ME IN to equal \n"?
- Why is there a difference in the answers from 43-45 and 53-55? Seems like the same strings.
    - Figured it out, the beginning of the string in the second one is the "I" and not the new line string
-
